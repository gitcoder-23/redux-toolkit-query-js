# Getting Started with Redux Toolkit Query js

This project was bootstrapped with [Deployed App Link RTKQ js](https://redux-toolkit-query-js.vercel.app/).

# What is Redux-Toolkit-Query

RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

RTK Query is an optional addon included in the Redux Toolkit package, and its functionality is built on top of the other APIs in Redux Toolkit.
